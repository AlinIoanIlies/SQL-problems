/*Create a trigger that checks if the hire date of an employee is higher than the current date. If true, set the hire date to equal the current date.
Format the output appropriately (YY-mm-dd).
Extra challenge: You can try to declare a new variable called 'today' which stores today's data, and then use it in your trigger!
After creating the trigger, execute the following code to see if it's working properly.*/
