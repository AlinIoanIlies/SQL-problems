- employee number
- the lowest department number among the departments where the employee has worked in (Hint: use a subquery to retrieve this value from the 'dept_emp' table)
- assign '110022' as 'manager' to all individuals whose employee number is lower than or equal to 10020, and '110039' to those whose number is between 10021 and 10040 inclusive.
Use a CASE statement to create the third field.*/
